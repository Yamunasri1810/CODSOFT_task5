Credit Card Fraud Detection

Step 1: Problem Definition
Predicting whether the Transaction is fraudless or fraud transaction.

Step 2: Data Collection
Collect the credit card dataset, and reading the data using the panda library.

Step 3: Data Exploration and Cleaning
Exploring the data to understand its structure, summary statistics, and identify missing values.

Step 4:Data Cleaning
Handle Missing Values: Fill or drop missing values.
Convert Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features into numerical features.

Step 5: Data Visualization
Using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data distributions and relationships.

Step 6: Feature Selection
Selecting the features that will be used for training the model. This may involve dropping irrelevant features or creating new ones.

Step 7: Model Selection
Choose a machine learning algorithm. Here Supervised Learning Algorithm(Logistic Regression) is used to train the model.

Step 8: Model Training
Training the selected model using the training data.

Step 9: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision.
